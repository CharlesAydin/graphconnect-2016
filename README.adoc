= GraphHack - Graph Connect Europe 2016

It's link:http://graphconnect.com/[Graph Connect] time again and for link:http://www.meetup.com/graphdb-london/events/227911674/[this year's hackathon] we've gone with a transport theme.

The folllowing are some datasets to get you started:

== Transport for London

link:data/runtimes.csv[runtimes.csv] contains underground stations, distances between adjacent stations and the run time between stations on different lines.

You can use link:data/load_csv.cql[this Cypher script] to load the data into Neo4j.

Alternatively you could download data from the link:https://api.tfl.gov.uk/[TFL unified API]. You can get accident stats, train and bus routes, disruptions and a few other things as well. You can also see the link:https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs[docs page] for this API.

== Roads

link:http://data.dft.gov.uk/gb-traffic-matrix/Traffic-major-roads-miles.csv[Traffic-major-roads-miles.csv] contains 250,000 of the major roads in the UK, how they're connected to each other and the traffic volume by vehicle type.

link:http://data.dft.gov.uk/gb-traffic-matrix/all-traffic-data-metadata.pdf[This document] explains the dataset in more detail.

Jacqui Reed also has a link:http://neo4j.com/graphgist/be209beb-6884-4d8b-850b-7c17ffab8f3c[graphgist] showing different queries around the major roads in Staines!

== Road Safety

link:https://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data[Road Safety Data] contains information on road accidents stretching back to 1979.

You can also download accidents for single years if you want to work with a smaller dataset.
